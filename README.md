Capture website
=====

Docker image for capturing screenshots of websites. The container wraps around
[capture-website](https://github.com/sindresorhus/capture-website) and
[capture-website-cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/capture-website-cli).

‚ö°Usage
-----

The **capture-website** CLI utility, that is wrapped within the container, can be accessed as so:

```shell
$ docker run --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --rm --volume ./screenshots:/app/screenshots ghcr.io/gocom/capture-website:master --help
```

If the command passed to the container is not existing executable, starts with `--` or `capture-website`,
the given command is passed down to `capture-website`, and the process is run as `app:app` user. If the container
is started as root, the `app` user is automatically mapped to the user defined with `HOST_UID` environment variable.

‚ùïNote that the image requires `SYS_ADMIN` capability since the container runs a sandboxed browser process inside of
it. The image may work without it on some host systems, but will fail on others.

üìù Example usage
-----

### Basic Docker CLI usage

The following would take screenshot of the given URL and save results to the screenshots directory:

```shell
$ docker run --rm --volume ./screenshots:/app/screenshots ghcr.io/gocom/capture-website https://example.com/ --output=/screenshots/sreenshot.png
```

### With Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a common way to orchestrate containers in local development environments. When using Docker Compose,
the **capture-website** service can use and access Docker networks and hostname mappings. For example:

```yml
services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:mainline
    networks:
      - proxy

  capture-website:
    image: ghcr.io/gocom/capture-website:0.1.0
    volumes:
      - ./screenshots:/screenshots
    networks:
      - proxy
    cap_add:
      - SYS_ADMIN

networks:
  proxy:
```

The `capture-website` can now access the `nginx` hostname to take screenshots of it:

```shell
$ docker compose run --rm capture-website http://nginx/ --output=/screenshots/sreenshot.png
```

ü´ß Environment variables
-----

The following environment variables can be used to customize the generated certificates.

| Variable                   | Default Value                   | Description                                                                                                                                                |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `HOST_UID`                 | `1000`                          | If the container is started as root, maps the default start up command's user to the specified UID. Generated files will be owned by the specified user.   |
| `HOST_GID`                 | `1000`                          | If the container is started as root, maps the default start up command's group as the specified GID. Generated files will be owned by the specified group. |
